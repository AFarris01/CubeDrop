Things listed in this file are tasks in CubeDrop that need work. They are 
divided by category, and by the file which requires the work. Individual files
may also have lists of things that need doing inside them.

Objective: 
    * Implement a simple Tetris(tm) clone, with extra features (loosely-based on that extended tetris gameboy game I used to have...)
    
Desired Features(In order of Importance):
    * Basic Tetris game (14 by 20)
    * Variable Scale Tetris (X by Y)
    * Scoreboarding
    * Timed Tetris
    * Extended Tetris Features ( New block types, powerups?, bonus point scores, etc... )
    * Adventure Tetris (with the little dude running around, and the killer-claw/treasure)
    * Re-themeing/skinning the game
    * Dynamic screen resizing (maybe) [physical size, not board geometry]

Current 'Do Want's:
    * Change documentation strings from this format:
        """
        function/object description
        INPUTS:
        RETURNS:
        ERRORS:
        """
       to something more like this:
        """
        function(prototype): return Something
        
        description
        Errors:
        """
    * Cube graphics need a better way to define what color to replace
    * Need to make some unittests for the different modules
    * ScoreBoard
    * Adventure Mode
    * Resizable screen/board dimensions
    * Block Powerups?
    * 'Addicted for <amount of time>' message, or counter for each session
    * Sound system
