This is CubeDrop.  

CubeDrop is essentially a Tetris clone, but with a few compelling 
additional capabilities/features added by me for experimentation porpoises.

I wrote this game many years ago on a whim in an attempt to get more familiar with Pygame.
The end goal was to build a fully functional game that I could use as a stepping stone to create more interesting things.
It has not been updated since that time.

Notable currently-accessible features of CubeDrop:
* Basic Tetris game
* Preview of upcoming pieces
* Custom art (all done by me) 
* Sounds (Royalty-free clips from the tubes of the internets)
* Music (Was going to be by me, but it turns out I'm terrible at music so instead I used the demo track "RandomProjectNumber14253" by Skiessi from LMMS. Good stuff.)
* Custom pieces for unique gameplay options

Implemented but inaccessible (without some hacking) features
* Arbitrary game board sizes
* Create custom pieces on the fly
* Custom piece textures

Planned (but non-implemented) features
* More sophisticated difficulty scaling
* Adventure mode
* Bastard mode
* Multi-player & vs AI

Known bugs:
* Hiscores don't work
    - The scoreboard was implemented originally, but the code was lost.
      At the time I was sharing my code between my desktop and laptops manually, before I started using Git.  
      As a result, one on my laptops has the codebase with hiscores implemented, and it never migrated properly to the desktop.
      If I find it, I'll make a new commit and upload it here.
